Authentication
</H3>

<P>
The Cluster Manager authenticates all communication using one of two
approaches: interactive login using a username and password, or an API key.

<P>
When a client provides a username and password, a JWT token is returned
that is valid for a relatively short period of time (default is 8
hours and can be changed in the Cluster Manager configuration). This
is handy when using the Web User Interface or command-line tools
such as <TT>gurobi_cl</TT> or <TT>grbcluster</TT>.

<P>
An API key is composed of an access ID and a secret key.  API keys are
the recommended method for connecting to the Cluster Manager from an
application.  When creating an API key, you can specify an optional
application name and a description to help keep track of how the key
is being used.  Once a key is created, you can download an associated
client license file, which contains the API access ID, the secret key,
and the Cluster Manager URL. This file can be used by client
applications and command-line tools to connect to the Cluster
Manager. The Cluster Manager keeps track of the timestamp and IP
address of the last API key usage.  The owner of the API key or the
system administrator can enable or disable an API key.  These features
simplify the task of monitoring API keys, detecting unwanted usage,
and safely rotating keys by disabling previous keys before permanently
deleting them.

<P>
For each account, the system administrator can enable or disable
interactive login or API key authentication.  This can be done at creation
time, or it can be done later by editing the account properties. An
account that only allows interactive login will not be allowed to create,
use, or manage API keys. An account that only allows API key
authentication (known as a <code>system account</code>)
can only be used for programmatic access through the
REST API.

<P>
The system administrator can disable and later reenable a user
account. When an account has been disabled, interactive login and/or
API key authentication will fail and access to the Cluster Manager
will not be granted. Disabled accounts will appear with a grayed icon
in the user account table.  The tooltip will indicate the reason.

<P>
To simplify installation, the Cluster Manager initially has three
default users with predefined passwords:

<UL>
<LI>standard user: <TT>gurobi</TT> / <TT>pass</TT>
</LI>
<LI>administrator: <TT>admin</TT> / <TT>admin</TT>
</LI>
<LI>system administrator: <TT>sysadmin</TT> / <TT>cluster</TT>
</LI>
</UL>
You should of course change the passwords or delete these accounts
before actually using the cluster.

<P>
