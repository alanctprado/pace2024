Upgrading an Existing Installation
</H2>

<P>
If you wish to upgrade to a new Gurobi release, you can of course shut
down the cluster, upgrade the Compute Server nodes and the Cluster
Manager instances, and restart all of the components.  However, if you
have set up a scalable architecture with a load balancer in front of
the Cluster Manager instances, you can do a rolling upgrade to
minimize the impact to the existing users. In this case, we recommend
the following process:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>First, upgrade the Cluster Manager. New Cluster Manager
  instances can be added to the cluster and old ones can be
  progressively terminated.
</LI>
<LI>Then, upgrade the Compute Server nodes, one at a time. To do so,
  use the Cluster Manager to stop a node so that new jobs will not be
  scheduled but existing jobs will continue until completion. Once the
  node has fully stopped, upgrade the node and add it back to the
  cluster.  This can be repeated for each node.
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
We also recommend to test this process in a QA environment to
understand the different steps and how they apply to your specific
environment.

<P>
In all cases, when installing the Cluster Manager on an existing
deployment, the database schema may need to be upgraded. Please check
the release notes to locate the schema for the version you are
upgrading to.

<P>
For a minor upgrade, the database will be automatically migrated when
starting the Cluster Manager.  During that process, new fields will be
added and indexes will be dropped and recreated. No data will be
deleted, and migrating is a safe process. However, a backup of the
data is still recommended before the upgrade is started.

<P>
For a major upgrade, please carefully follow the directions in the
release notes. The upgrade will not be triggered automatically, and
you will be advised to take a backup of your database first.

<P>
In all cases, you can display the schema information and trigger the upgrade manually
with the <TT>grb_rsm database</TT> command. For example, if you were running
version 9.1.2, and you are upgrading to 9.5.0, this command will display the following:

<P>

<TT>&gt; grb_rsm database 
<BR>
info  : Current schema version is 1.0.0
<BR>
info  : Latest schema version is 1.1.0
<BR>
info  : Please consider upgrading the database schema with 'grb_rsm database &mdash;upgrade' command
<BR></TT>

<P>
If you want to proceed with the upgrade at this time, use the  <TT>&mdash;upgrade</TT> flag:

<P>

<TT>&gt; grb_rsm database &mdash;upgrade 
<BR>
info  : Starting database schema upgrade
<BR>
info  : Database schema, replacing 6 indexes
<BR>
info  : Database schema upgraded from version 1.0.0 to version 1.1.0
<BR>
info  : Database upgraded
<BR></TT>

<P>
