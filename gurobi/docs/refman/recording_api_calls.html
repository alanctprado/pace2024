Recording API Calls
</H1>

<P>
The Gurobi Optimizer provides the option to record the set of Gurobi
commands issued by your program and store them to a file.  The
commands can be played back later using the <A HREF="grb_command_line_tool.html#sec:CommandLine">Gurobi
  Command-Line Tool</A>.  If you replay the commands
on a machine with the same specs (operating system, core count, and
instruction set) as the machine where you created the recording, your
Gurobi calls will take the exact same computational paths that they
took when you ran your original program.

<P>
Recording can be useful in a number of situations.

<UL>
<LI>If you want to understand how much time is being spent in Gurobi
  routines, the replay will show you the total time spent in Gurobi
  API routines, and the total time spent in Gurobi algorithms.
</LI>
<LI>If you want to check for leaks of Gurobi data, the replay will
  show you how many Gurobi models and environments were never freed by
  your program.
</LI>
<LI>If you run into a question or an issue and you would like to get
  help from Gurobi, your recording will allow Gurobi technical support
  to reproduce the exact results that you are seeing without requiring
  you to send your entire application.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Recording is useful for testing across deployment scenarios. In
particular, you can do the following:

<UL>
<LI>A recording made on a Compute Server can be replayed on a
Compute Server or locally. By default, the recording will use
<code>localhost:61000</code>; this can be overridden by setting the
<code>GRB_COMPUTESERVER</code> environment variable. If
<code>GRB_COMPUTESERVER</code> is set to an empty string, the replay will
occur locally.
</LI>
<LI>A Cluster Manager recording can be replayed via a Cluster
Manager, on a Compute Server, or locally.
<code>GRB_COMPUTESERVER</code> has priority over
<code>GRB_CSMANAGER</code>. If <code>GRB_CSMANAGER</code> is set to "", the
replay will run locally or on the specified Compute Server.
</LI>
<LI>A Gurobi Instant Cloud recording can be replayed on the cloud,
on a Compute Server, or locally. Setting <code>GRB_CLOUDACCESSID</code>
and <code>GRB_CLOUDSECRETKEY</code> will run the replay on the cloud.
<code>GRB_COMPUTESERVER</code> has priority over <code>GRB_CLOUDACCESSID</code>
(and <code>GRB_CLOUDSECRETKEY</code>). If <code>GRB_CLOUDACCESSID</code> is set to "",
the replay will run locally or on the specified Compute Server.
</LI>
<LI>A token server recording can be replayed. The recording tries
to use a token server at <code>localhost</code> (with the default port
41954). This can be overridden by setting the <code>GRB_TOKENSERVER</code>
environment variable. If <code>GRB_TOKENSERVER</code> is set to an empty
string, the replay will be done using a local license.
</LI>
<LI>A recording that includes the <code>WorkerPool</code> parameter
(used in the distributed MIP and distributed concurrent algorithms)
can only be done by setting the <code>GRB_WORKERPOOL</code> environment
variable.
</LI>
</UL>
For recordings of optimization with Compute Server or Instant Cloud,
the recording will query
the number of processors and cores from the remote worker and store
this information in the recording file.
When replaying a recording file, Gurobi uses these stored
values.
