IIS Logging
</H2>

<P>
Recall that an Irreducible Infeasible Subsystem (IIS) is a subset of
the constraints and variable bounds in your infeasible model with the
following properties:

<UL>
<LI>It is still infeasible, and
</LI>
<LI>If a single constraint or bound is removed, the subsystem becomes feasible.
</LI>
</UL>
The process of identifying an IIS is one of addition and subtraction.
The algorithm grows a set of constraints and bounds that are known to
be part of an IIS, and also a set that are known not to be.  You can
track the progress of this process in the IIS log.

The first two columns show the minimum and maximum sizes of the set
of constraints in the IIS.  The fourth and fifth column give the same
information for the set of variable bounds.  The final column shows
elapsed runtime.

<P>
The third and sixth columns in the IIS log provide guesses at the
final size of the IIS.  Computing an IIS can be quite time-consuming,
and it is often useful to have a sense of how large the result will
be.  These guesses can be quite accurate in some cases, but
unfortunately there are some models that can fool our heuristic.  You
should treat these as very rough estimates.

<P>
When the process completes, the algorithm outputs the size of the IIS
(the number of constraints and bounds in the irreducible subsystem):
<PRE>
IIS computed: 102 constraints, 0 bounds
IIS runtime: 129.91 seconds
</PRE>
Note in this case that early guesses were in the neighborhood of 50
constraints, but the IIS contained 102.

<P>
If you terminate the process early, you will get a non-minimal
infeasible subsystem instead:
<PRE>
Non-minimal IIS computed: 3179 constraints, 0 bounds
IIS runtime: 120.29 seconds
</PRE>
