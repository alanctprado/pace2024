<P>
As we progress from higher-priority objectives to lower-priority
objectives in a hierarchical multi-objective model, we won't
necessarily solve each pass to exact optimality.
By default, termination criteria (e.g.
<A HREF="timelimit.html#parameter:TimeLimit">TimeLimit</A>,
<A HREF="solutionlimit.html#parameter:SolutionLimit">SolutionLimit</A>,
etc.) are controlled by the
parameters defined in the model environment.  However, we provide a
feature called <SPAN  CLASS="textit">multi-objective environments</SPAN> that allows you to
create a Gurobi environment for each optimization pass and set
parameters on those environments.  Those settings will only affect the
corresponding pass of the multi-objective optimization.  Thus, for
example, if the <A HREF="timelimit.html#parameter:TimeLimit">TimeLimit</A>
parameter for the model is 100, but you use a multi-objective
environment to set the parameter to 10 for a particular optimization pass,
then the multi-objective optimization will spend at most 10 seconds on
that particular pass (and at most 100 seconds in total).

<P>
To create a multi-objective environment for a particular optimization pass,
use the <code>getMultiobjEnv</code> method from your language API (e.g.
<A HREF="py_model_getmultiobjenv.html#pythonmethod:Model.getMultiobjEnv">Model.getMultiobjEnv</A>
in Python).  The <code>index</code> argument gives the index of the
optimization pass that you want to control.

<P>
Please note that optimization passes and objectives are not quite synonymous, due
the possibility of blending objectives at the same priority level.
Multi-objective environment 0 is always tied to the highest
priority (possibly blended) objective, while multi-objective environment
1 is always tied to the second highest priority objective (if any).
For details on how multiple objectives with the same priority are
treated, please refer to the
<A HREF="working_with_multiple_obje.html#heading:HierarchicalObjectives">hierarchical objectives</A> section.

<P>
Once you create multi-objective environments, they will be used for
every subsequent multi-objective optimization on that model. Use the
<code>discardMultiobjEnvs</code> method from your language API (e.g.
<A HREF="py_model_discardmultiobjen.html#pythonmethod:Model.discardMultiobjEnvs">Model.discardMultiobjEnvs</A>
in Python) to revert back to default multi-objective optimization
behavior.

<P>
Please note that parameter values are copied from the model when the
multi-objective environment is created.  Therefore, changes to parameter
values on the model have no effect on multi-objective environments that
have already been created.  This is a frequent source of confusion.

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="LARGE"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Other Details</SPAN></SPAN>

<P>
We haven't attempted to generalize the notions of dual solutions or
simplex bases for continuous multi-objective models, so you can't
query attributes such as <A HREF="pi.html#attr:Pi">Pi</A>,
<A HREF="rc.html#attr:RC">RC</A>, <A HREF="vbasis.html#attr:VBasis">VBasis</A>, or
<A HREF="cbasis.html#attr:CBasis">CBasis</A> for multi-objective solutions.
Because of this, we've concluded that the most consistent result
to return for attribute <A HREF="ismip.html#attr:IsMIP">IsMIP</A> is 1.
Note, however, that several MIP-specific attributes such as
<A HREF="objbound.html#attr:ObjBound">ObjBound</A>,
<A HREF="objboundc.html#attr:ObjBoundC">ObjBoundC</A> and
<A HREF="mipgap.html#attr:MIPGap">MIPGap</A> don't make sense
for multi-objective models and are also not available.

<P>
Gurobi will only solve multi-objective models with strictly linear
objectives.  If the primary objective is quadratic or piecewise
linear, the solve call will return an error.

<P>
When solving a continuous multi-objective model using a hierarchical
approach, you have a choice of which optimization algorithm to use for
the different passes (primal simplex, dual simplex, or barrier).  The
first pass will always use the algorithm specified in the
<A HREF="method.html#parameter:Method">Method</A> parameter.  The algorithm for
subsequent passes is controlled by the
<A HREF="multiobjmethod.html#parameter:MultiObjMethod">MultiObjMethod</A> parameter.
This parameter has no effect for multi-objective MIP models.
Note you can get finer-grained control over the algorithm choice
using our multi-objective environment feature, by setting the
<A HREF="method.html#parameter:Method">Method</A> parameter for individual
objectives.

<P>
For the hierarchical approach, Gurobi will perform a conservative
presolve step at the beginning of the multi-objective optimization,
and a more aggressive presolve step at the beginning of each pass
(assuming presolve hasn't been turned off).  You can optionally
perform a more aggressive presolve step at the beginning of the
multi-objective optimization by setting parameter
<A HREF="multiobjpre.html#parameter:MultiObjPre">MultiObjPre</A> to value 2.  This
can help performance, but it makes a few simplifying assumptions that
could lead to small degradations in the values achieved for
lower-priority objectives.

<P>
The log file when using a hierarchical approach will show optimization
progress for each pass in the process.  You'll see log lines that look
like this:
<PRE>
Multi-objectives: optimize objective 1 (Obj1Name) ...
...
Multi-objectives: optimize objective 2 (weighted) ...
...
</PRE>
For further details, please see section
<A HREF="multi_objective_logging.html#sec:MultiObjectiveLogging">Multi-Objective Logging</A>.

<P>
Callbacks are available for multi-objective optimization, but they are
a bit more involved than those for single-objective optimization.
When you are solving for a specific objective (either in one phase of
a hierarchical optimization or when solving a blended objective), you
will receive callbacks from the algorithm that solves that model: MIP
callbacks if the model is a MIP, and simplex or barrier callbacks if
the model is continuous.  For a hierarchical objective, you will also
get a <code>MULTIOBJ</code> callback at the end of each phase that allows
you to query the current solution, the number of solutions found, and
the number of objectives that have been solved for at that point.
Refer to the <A HREF="cb_codes.html#sec:CallbackCodes">Callback</A>
discussion for further details.
