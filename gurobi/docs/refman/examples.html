Examples</A>
</H2>

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Parameter usage</SPAN>

<P>
Let's continue with a few examples on how the parameters 
related to solution pools would be
used.  Imagine that you are solving a MIP model with an optimal
(minimization) objective of 100.  Further imagine that, using default
settings, the MIP solver finds four solutions to this model with
objectives 100, 110, 120, and 130.

<P>
If you set the <A HREF="poolsolutions.html#parameter:PoolSolutions">PoolSolutions</A>
parameter to 3 and solve the model again, the MIP solver would 
return with 3 solutions in the solution pool
(i.e., the <A HREF="solcount.html#attr:SolCount">SolCount</A> attribute would have
value 3, and the objective values would be 100, 110 and 120).
If you instead set the
<A HREF="poolgap.html#parameter:PoolGap">PoolGap</A> parameter to value
<code>0.2</code>, the MIP solver would discard any solutions whose objective
value is worse than 120 (which would also leave 3 solutions in the
solution pool).

<P>
If you set the <A HREF="poolsearchmode.html#parameter:PoolSearchMode">PoolSearchMode</A> 
parameter to 1 and the <A HREF="poolsolutions.html#parameter:PoolSolutions">PoolSolutions</A>
parameter to 10, the MIP solver would continue running after having found 
an optimal solution trying to find and store 10 solutions, but with no 
guarantee on the quality of the additional solutions. 

<P>
If you set the <A HREF="poolsearchmode.html#parameter:PoolSearchMode">PoolSearchMode</A>
parameter to 2 and the
<A HREF="poolsolutions.html#parameter:PoolSolutions">PoolSolutions</A> parameter to 10,
the MIP solver would attempt to find the 10 best solutions to the
model.  An <code>OPTIMAL</code> return status would indicate that either (i)
it found the 10 best solutions, or (ii) it found all feasible
solutions to the model, and there were fewer than 10.  If you also set
the <A HREF="poolgap.html#parameter:PoolGap">PoolGap</A> parameter to a value of
0.1, the MIP solver would try to find 10 solutions with objective no
worse than 110.  While this may appear equivalent to asking for 10
solutions and simply ignoring those with objective worse than 110, the
solve will typically complete significantly faster with this parameter
set, since the solver does not have to expend effort looking for
solutions beyond the requested gap.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Interpreting attribute information</SPAN>

<P>
Let's try to better understand the attributes related to solution pools. 
Consider again a minimization problem where the  
parameter settings <code>PoolSearchMode=2</code> and <code>PoolSolutions=10</code> 
have been used.

<P>
First, imagine that the solver terminated with an <code>OPTIMAL</code>
return status. We look at several possible 
hypothetical values of some attributes:

<P>

<UL>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textit">Case 1</SPAN>: <code>ObjVal=100</code>, <code>ObjBound=100</code>, 
<code>PoolObjBound=500</code>, and the objective value of the 10th solution in the 
pool is 500.

<P>
The first solution in the pool is optimal (because <code>ObjVal</code> and 
<code>ObjBound</code> are equal), and the solver was able to find 10 solutions 
of value at most 500. Because <code>PoolObjBound=500</code>, we know 
that all solutions that the solver did not find 
have an objective value of at least 500. Since the last solution in the pool has 
value 500, the 10 solutions in the pool are definitely the 10 best solutions.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textit">Case 2</SPAN>: <code>ObjVal=100</code>, <code>ObjBound=100</code>, 
<code>PoolObjBound=+infinity</code>, <code>SolCount=7</code>, and the values of the 
7th and 8th solutions in the pool are 350 and <code>+infinity</code>, respectively.

<P>
The solver has found 7 solutions and has proven that no other 
feasible solution for the model exists. The best of these 7 solutions 
has objective 100, the worst of them has objective 350.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Now, imagine that the solver terminated early due to a time limit 
(return status <code>TIME_LIMIT</code>). Again, we look at several possible 
hypothetical values of some attributes:

<P>

<UL>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textit">Case 3:</SPAN> <code>ObjVal=100</code>, <code>ObjBound=50</code>, 
<code>PoolObjBound=50</code>

<P>
Since <code>ObjBound</code> &lt; <code>ObjVal</code>, the solver did 
not prove optimality of the 
incumbent solution (the first solution in the pool). 
There can be better solutions
than the incumbent.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textit">Case 4:</SPAN> <code>ObjVal=100</code>, <code>ObjBound=100</code>, 
<code>PoolObjBound=100</code>, 
and the objective value of the 10th solution in the pool is 500. 

<P>
The first solution in the pool is optimal (because <code>ObjVal</code> 
and <code>ObjBound</code>
are equal), and the solver was able to find 10 solutions with objective 
value at most 500. 
Because <code>PoolObjBound=100</code>, we know that all solutions 
that the solver did not find 
have an objective value of at least 100. Since the value of the 
last solution in the pool is 500, it could be the case that there exist 
10 or more solutions with objective smaller than 500 (but 
greater than or equal to 100). In particular, solutions that are 
currently in the pool and have objective value greater than 100 
might not be among the 10 best solutions.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textit">Case 5:</SPAN> <code>ObjVal=100</code>, <code>ObjBound=100</code>, 
<code>PoolObjBound=200</code>, 
and the objective values of the 4th, 5th and 10th solutions in the pool are 
180, 220 and 500, respectively.

<P>
The first solution in the pool is optimal (because <code>ObjVal</code> 
and <code>ObjBound</code>
are equal), and the solver was able to find 10 solutions of value at most 500. 
Because <code>PoolObjBound=200</code>, we know that all solutions 
that the solver did not find 
have an objective value of at least 200. 
This means that the first 4 solutions 
in the pool (up to the solution with value 180) 
are definitely the best four solutions 
that exist. The 5th solution with value 220 (and subsequent solutions 
in the pool) may be inferior to other undiscovered solutions.
</LI>
</UL>
