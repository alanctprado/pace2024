Working With Multiple Objectives</A>
</H2>

<P>
Of course, specifying a set of objectives is only the first step in
solving a multi-objective optimization problem.  The next step is to
indicate how the objectives should be combined.  As noted earlier, we
support two approaches: blended and hierarchical.

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="LARGE"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Blended Objectives</SPAN></SPAN>
<A ID="heading:BlendedObjectives"></A>
<P>
A blending approach creates a single objective by taking a linear
combination of your objectives.  You provide a weight for each
objective as an argument to <code>setObjectiveN</code>.  Alternatively, you
can use the <A HREF="objnweight.html#attr:ObjNWeight">ObjNWeight</A> attribute,
together with <A HREF="objnumber.html#parameter:ObjNumber">ObjNumber</A>.  The
default weight for an objective is 1.0.

<P>
To give an example, if your model has two objectives, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 STYLE="height: 2.17ex; vertical-align: -0.57ex; " SRC="img291.svg"
 ALT="$1 + x + 2y$"></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 STYLE="height: 2.17ex; vertical-align: -0.57ex; " SRC="img292.svg"
 ALT="$y
+ 2z$"></SPAN>, and if you give weights of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 STYLE="height: 1.92ex; vertical-align: -0.31ex; " SRC="img89.svg"
 ALT="$-1$"></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 STYLE="height: 1.72ex; vertical-align: -0.12ex; " SRC="img132.svg"
 ALT="$2$"></SPAN> to them, respectively,
then Gurobi would solve your model with a blended objective of
<!-- MATH
 $-1 \cdot (1 + x + 2y) + 2 \cdot (y + 2z) = -1 - x + 4z$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 STYLE="height: 2.55ex; vertical-align: -0.70ex; " SRC="img293.svg"
 ALT="$-1 \cdot (1 + x + 2y) + 2 \cdot (y + 2z) = -1 - x + 4z$"></SPAN>.

<P>
You should avoid weights that are very large or very small.  A very
large weight (i.e., larger than <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 STYLE="height: 2.12ex; vertical-align: -0.12ex; " SRC="img294.svg"
 ALT="$10^6$"></SPAN>) may lead to very large
objective coefficients, which can cause numerical difficulties.  A
very small weight (i.e., smaller than <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 STYLE="height: 1.92ex; vertical-align: -0.31ex; " SRC="img232.svg"
 ALT="$1e-6$"></SPAN>) may cause the
contribution from that objective to the overall blended objective to
be smaller than tolerances, which may lead to that objective being
effectively ignored.

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="LARGE"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Hierarchical Objectives</SPAN></SPAN>
<A ID="heading:HierarchicalObjectives"></A>
<P>
A hierarchical or lexicographic approach assigns a priority to each
objective, and optimizes for the objectives in decreasing priority
order.  During each of these optimization passes, it finds the best solution for the current
objective, but only from among those that would not degrade the
solution quality for higher-priority objectives.  You provide the
priority for each objective as an argument to <code>setObjectiveN</code>.
Alternatively, you can use the
<A HREF="objnpriority.html#attr:ObjNPriority">ObjNPriority</A> attribute.  Priorities
are integral, not continuous.  Larger values indicate higher
priorities.  The default priority for an objective is 0.

<P>
To give an example, if your model has two objectives, with priorities
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 STYLE="height: 1.72ex; vertical-align: -0.12ex; " SRC="img295.svg"
 ALT="$10$"></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 STYLE="height: 1.72ex; vertical-align: -0.12ex; " SRC="img296.svg"
 ALT="$5$"></SPAN>, and objective weights 1.0 and -1.0. Assuming the optimal
solution for the first objective has value <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 STYLE="height: 1.72ex; vertical-align: -0.12ex; " SRC="img297.svg"
 ALT="$100$"></SPAN>, then the solver will
find the solution that optimizes <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 STYLE="height: 1.92ex; vertical-align: -0.31ex; " SRC="img89.svg"
 ALT="$-1$"></SPAN> times the second objective
from among all solutions with objective <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 STYLE="height: 1.72ex; vertical-align: -0.12ex; " SRC="img297.svg"
 ALT="$100$"></SPAN> for the first objective.

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="LARGE"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Allowing Multiple-Objective Degradation</SPAN></SPAN>

<P>
By default, our hierarchical approach won't allow later objectives to
degrade earlier objectives, subject to the user-given ending gap
conditions for the optimization problem. More precisely, the base
value used to define what solutions are acceptable for lower
priorities objectives &ndash; for a minimization problem &ndash; is computed as:

<P>
<DIV class="CENTER">
<!-- MATH
 $\mathrm{base\_value} = \max\{bestsol, bestbound + |bestsol|*rgap,
bestbound + agap\},$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 STYLE="height: 2.55ex; vertical-align: -0.70ex; " SRC="img298.svg"
 ALT="$\mathrm{base\_value} = \max\{bestsol, bestbound + \vert bestsol\vert*rgap,
bestbound + agap\},
$"></SPAN>
</DIV>

<P>
where <code>bestsol</code> is the value of the best incumbent solution,
<code>bestbound</code> is the value of the best proven lower bound for the
problem, <code>rgap</code> is the <A HREF="mipgap2.html#parameter:MIPGap">relative MIP
gap</A>, and <code>agap</code> is the <A HREF="mipgapabs.html#parameter:MIPGapAbs">absolute MIP
gap</A>, and the set of feasible solutions for
the next objective will consider solutions whose objective value is at
most that value.

<P>
This behavior can be relaxed for MIPs through a
pair of tolerances: a relative and an absolute tolerance.  These are
provided as arguments to <code>setObjectiveN</code>, or they can be set
using attributes <A HREF="objnreltol.html#attr:ObjNRelTol">ObjNRelTol</A> and
<A HREF="objnabstol.html#attr:ObjNAbsTol">ObjNAbsTol</A>.  By setting one of these
for a particular objective, you can indicate that later objectives are
allowed to degrade this objective by the specified relative or
absolute amount, respectively.  In our earlier example, if the optimal
value for the first objective is <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 STYLE="height: 1.72ex; vertical-align: -0.12ex; " SRC="img297.svg"
 ALT="$100$"></SPAN>, and if we set
<code>ObjNAbsTol</code> for this objective to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 STYLE="height: 1.72ex; vertical-align: -0.12ex; " SRC="img299.svg"
 ALT="$20$"></SPAN>, then the second
optimization pass would find the best solution for the second
objective from among all solutions with objective <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 STYLE="height: 1.72ex; vertical-align: -0.12ex; " SRC="img300.svg"
 ALT="$120$"></SPAN> or better for
the first objective.  Note that if you modify both tolerances, later
optimizations would use the looser of the two values (i.e., the one
that allows the larger degradation).

<P>
Objective degradations are handled differently for multi-objective LP
models.  For LP models, solution quality for higher-priority objectives is
maintained by fixing some variables to their values in previous
optimal solutions.  These fixings are decided using variable reduced
costs.  The value of the <code>ObjNAbsTol</code> parameter indicates the
amount by which a fixed variable's reduced cost is allowed to violate
dual feasibility, whereas the <code>ObjNRelTol</code> parameter is simply
ignored.
If you want the MIP behavior, where the degradation is controlled
more directly, you can add a dummy binary variable to the model, thus
transforming it into a MIP.  Solving the resulting multi-objective MIP
will be much more time consuming than solving the original multi-objective LP.

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="LARGE"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Combining Blended and Hierarchical Objectives</SPAN></SPAN>
<A ID="heading:CombiningBlendedAndHierarchicalObjectives"></A>
<P>
Every objective in a multi-objective model has both a weight and a
priority, which allows you to seamlessly combine blended and
hierarchical approaches.  To understand how this works, we should
first provide more detail on how hierarchical objectives are handled.

<P>
When you specify a different priority for each of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 STYLE="height: 1.23ex; vertical-align: -0.12ex; " SRC="img25.svg"
 ALT="$n$"></SPAN> objectives, the
solver performs <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 STYLE="height: 1.23ex; vertical-align: -0.12ex; " SRC="img25.svg"
 ALT="$n$"></SPAN> separate optimization passes.  In each pass, in
decreasing priority order, it optimizes for the current objective
multiplied by its <A HREF="objnweight.html#attr:ObjNWeight">ObjNWeight</A>
attribute, while imposing constraints that ensure that the quality of
higher-priority objectives isn't degraded by more than the specified
tolerances.

<P>
If you give the same priority to multiple objectives, then they will
be handled in the same optimization pass, resulting in fewer than <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 STYLE="height: 1.23ex; vertical-align: -0.12ex; " SRC="img25.svg"
 ALT="$n$"></SPAN>
total passes for <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 STYLE="height: 1.23ex; vertical-align: -0.12ex; " SRC="img25.svg"
 ALT="$n$"></SPAN> objectives.  More precisely, one optimization pass
is performed per distinct priority value, in order of decreasing
priority, and all objectives with the same priority are blended
together, using the weights for those objectives.  This gives you
quite a bit of flexibility when combining the blended and hierarchical
approaches.

<P>
One subtle point when blending multiple objectives within a single
level in a hierarchical approach relates to the handling of
degradations from lower-priority levels.  The objective degradation
allowed after a blended optimization pass is the maximum absolute and
relative degradation allowed by each of the participating
objectives. For example, if we have three objectives with
<code>ObjNPriority</code> equal to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 STYLE="height: 2.55ex; vertical-align: -0.70ex; " SRC="img301.svg"
 ALT="$\{2, 2, 1\}$"></SPAN>, and <code>ObjNRelTol</code>
equal to <!-- MATH
 $\{0.10, 0.05, 0.00\}$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 STYLE="height: 2.55ex; vertical-align: -0.70ex; " SRC="img302.svg"
 ALT="$\{0.10, 0.05, 0.00\}$"></SPAN> and <code>ObjNAbsTol</code> equal to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 STYLE="height: 2.55ex; vertical-align: -0.70ex; " SRC="img303.svg"
 ALT="$\{0,
1, 2\}$"></SPAN>, and if the best solution for the first priority objective is
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 STYLE="height: 1.72ex; vertical-align: -0.12ex; " SRC="img295.svg"
 ALT="$10$"></SPAN>, then the allowed degradation for the first priority objective
in subsequent passes is
<!-- MATH
 $\max\{10 \cdot 0.10, 10 \cdot 0.05, 0, 1\}~=~1$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 STYLE="height: 2.55ex; vertical-align: -0.70ex; " SRC="img304.svg"
 ALT="$\max\{10 \cdot 0.10, 10 \cdot 0.05, 0, 1\}~=~1$"></SPAN>.

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="LARGE"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Querying multi-objective results</SPAN></SPAN>

<P>
Once you have found one or more solutions to your multi-objective
model, you can query the achieved objective value for each objective
on each solution.  Specifically, if you set the
<A HREF="objnumber.html#parameter:ObjNumber">ObjNumber</A> parameter to choose an
objective, and the
<A HREF="solutionnumber.html#parameter:SolutionNumber">SolutionNumber</A> parameter to
choose a solution, then the
<A HREF="objnval.html#attr:ObjNVal">ObjNVal</A> attribute will give the value of
the chosen objective on the chosen solution.  This is illustrated in
the following Python example:
<SCRIPT SRC="https://cdn.rawgit.com/google/code-prettify/master/loader/run_prettify.js"></SCRIPT>
<BR>
<PRE CLASS="prettyprint"># Read and solve a model with multiple objectives
m = read('input.mps')
m.optimize()

# get the set of variables
x = m.getVars()

# Ensure status is optimal
assert m.Status == GRB.Status.OPTIMAL

# Query number of multiple objectives, and number of solutions
nSolutions  = m.SolCount
nObjectives = m.NumObj
print('Problem has', nObjectives, 'objectives')
print('Gurobi found', nSolutions, 'solutions')

# For each solution, print value of first three variables, and
# value for each objective function
solutions = []
for s in range(nSolutions):
  # Set which solution we will query from now on
  m.params.SolutionNumber = s

  # Print objective value of this solution in each objective
  print('Solution', s, ':', end='')
  for o in range(nObjectives):
    # Set which objective we will query
    m.params.ObjNumber = o
    # Query the o-th objective value
    print(' ',m.ObjNVal, end='')

  # print first three variables in the solution
  n = min(len(x),3)
  for j in range(n):
    print(x[j].VarName, x[j].Xn, end='')
  print('')

  # query the full vector of the o-th solution
  solutions.append(m.getAttr('Xn',x))
